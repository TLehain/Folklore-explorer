    "teaser": "A knight, a dragon, and a curse passed down through the generations.",
    "content": "John Lambton, the heir of the Lambton Estate in County Durham was a rebellious character who missed church one Sunday to go fishing in the river Wear. He doesn’t catch anything until the church service finishes, at which point he fishes out a small worm-like creature with nine holes on each side of its Salamander looking head. Thinking he has caught what he thinks resembles the devil, he disposes of his catch by discarding it down a nearby well. He then grows up and joins the Crusades, eventually forgetting about what he had found.Many years later the worm has continued to grow and grow. Villagers start to notice livestock going missing and discover that the now fully grown worm has emerged from the well and is coiled around a local hill. The worm goes on to terrorise nearby villages before heading towards Lambton Castle. Lord Lambton manages to sedate the creature and a number of brave villagers try to kill the beast but fail. After seven years John Lambton returns from the Crusades to find his father’s estates almost destitute because of the worm. He decides to fight and kill the beast, but first seeks guidance of a wise witch. She tells him about the responsibility he now has over the worm, and that if he is to conquer it, he must then kill the first living thing he sees or else his family will be cursed for nine generations; and will not die in their beds. John agrees with his father that once the worm has been defeated, he shall sound his hunting horn three times to alert his father to release his favourite hound, which is to be killed to avoid the curse. John then goes on to fight the worm in the river. John eventually slays the worm after a fierce battle, and sounds the horn. Unfortunately, John’s father is so excited that the beast is dead that he forgets to release the hound and rushes out to congtratulate his son. John cannot bear to kill his father and so, after they meet, it is too late. It is said that nine generations of Lambtons are cursed so that they shall not die peacefully in their beds. This curse seems to have held true for at least three generations.",

    "teaser": "A young princess doomed to roam the castle, high on the rocks.",
    "content": "Bamburgh Castle stands high on a massive rock in Northumberland, England, along the North Sea. During the 11th century, it was the property of Robert, Earl of Northumberland, who foolishly started a quarrel with King William II. The king besieged the castle using a siege castle called Malvesin, or Evil Neighbor. The Earl was captured as he tried to escape to Tynemouth. Thereafter, the castle became royal property and underwent numerous additions and upgrades through the crown. The keep was completed by Henry II, while other restorations were carried out during the reign of King John and Henry III. During the Wars of the Roses, the Lancastrians occupied the castle. However, they relinquished the castle in 1464 to Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, who hammered it with artillery until the Lancastrians surrendered. Today, the castle remains intact and is one of the finest in England. The Armstrong Family currently resides therein, along with the ghost of a lady in pink. At some stage in Bamburgh's eventful history, the flesh and blood incarnation of this forlorn wraith was a Northumbrian princess. Her father disapproved of a boy she was in love with and sent the unfortunate suitor overseas for seven years. He forbade the couple to exchange messages and hoped that his daughter's passion would cool. But the girl just became more and more depressed. In a last attempt to persuade his daughter to give up her love, the king told her that spies had discovered the boy had married someone else. To cheer the girl up after this news, the king asked the castle seamstress to make a fine dress in his daughter's favorite color, pink. The distraught girl donned the garment, climbed the stairway to the highest battlements, and flung herself to her death on the rocks below. Shortly afterward, her lover returned from exile, unmarried, and was heartbroken by the news of what had happened. Legend does not record what fate befell him. Every seven years, the princesss mournful revenant, clothed in a dress of shimmering pink, wanders through the corridors of the oldest section of the castle before gliding down the rocky path that leads to the beach. Here she stands upon the pale gold sands, gazing sadly out to sea, forever awaiting the return of her lost love.",

One of the earliest confrontations occurred near Green Park, when a young woman claimed Jack attacked her with metallic claws and vanished over a 9-foot wall. Though sightings waned, his legend lived on, spawning a mix of fear, fascination, and penny dreadful stories across Victorian society.",

The ghost of Fanny Lynes, who allegedly died from smallpox—or possibly poison—was said to haunt the house of her former lover William Kent. Locals reported ghostly rappings, chilling moans, and public séances. The case gained nationwide attention, and even Dr. Samuel Johnson investigated. Eventually, it was discovered to be a hoax staged by a young girl under pressure. Still, the ‘Scratching Fanny’ of Cock Lane lives on in London folklore.",
